                <p><strong>Two-Language Approach:</strong> All Third Form pupils study two languages - one as a continuation from previous studies and one as a beginner language. This broad approach ensures exposure to different linguistic structures and cultural perspectives.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Cultural Enrichment:</strong> Language learning at College goes beyond grammar and vocabulary to include deep cultural understanding. Students explore history, traditions, and contemporary issues in French, Spanish, German, and classical cultures.</p>
                
                <p><strong>International Perspective:</strong> With EAL support for international students and classical studies connecting to ancient civilizations, the language programme develops true global awareness and cross-cultural communication skills essential for modern citizenship.</p>
                
                <p><strong>GCSE Preparation:</strong> All language courses provide solid grammatical foundations and cultural knowledge essential for successful GCSE study, with regular trips abroad and exchange programmes enhancing practical language use.</p>
